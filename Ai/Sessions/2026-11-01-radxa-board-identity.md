# Q8B board identity — 2026-11-01

## 2026-11-01 — Q8B identity implemented and checked

Owner authorized Ubuntu/Linux, ARM64 and Radxa Dragon Q8B identification.
Protected `radxa/q8b` commit `12e44feeff241334e184c86dc9daccdc7f9e4fa1` implements exact device-tree detection,
Python/C++ HardwareRadxa and local cereal enum `radxaQ8b @8`, preserving existing
ordinals and generic Linux `aarch64`, `COMMA_HARDWARE=False`, `PC=True` policy.
The read-only command reports actual Ubuntu24.04.5/ARM64/RadxaDragonQ8B. Dynamic
camera consumers explicitly reject missing Radxa calibration. No comma camera
calibration is claimed for this board.

11 Python tests, 4 actual C++→Python deviceState/initData message checks, SCons
profile detection, Ruff, syntax and diff checks passed. A detection mutation
was rejected by the tests. No full Sunnypilot build, camera/model/UI launch,
MSM runtime integration, hardware-health measurement or vehicle actuation was
performed. Generic hardware defaults remain unimplemented health providers.
Vendor stays clean at a86979d2; no upstream merge/push.
